      <h1>ISRO TAKES A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS GAGANYAAN '27</h1>
      <h2>Successfully completes a crucial test – <strong>Integrated Main Parachute Test (IMAT)</strong> </h2>
      
      <p class="article-meta">Published on December 13, 2025 | Category: Mission Update</p>
      
      <p>
        Union Minister of State for Science & Technology; MoS PMO, Department of Space, 
        Dr Jitendra Singh, told parliament on 3rd December 2025, that ISRO had successfully completed a crucial test – 
        the <strong>Integrated Main Parachute Test</strong> (IMAT) and has marked a major milestone in the roadmap for India’s first human spaceflight programme, Gaganyaan.</p>
        <p>IMAT is a crucial component of the ongoing qualification campaign for the Crew Module’s parachute-based deceleration system, 
            one of the most critical human-rating elements of the mission. 
            It involved simulation of one of the most extreme descent conditions: 
            a deliberate delay in the descent sequence between the two main parachutes. 
            This high-stress scenario was successfully demonstrated, 
            validating both the structural integrity and the load-bearing performance of the system under asymmetric forces.
        </p>
        <p>The Minister noted that this successful test significantly advanced the human-rating process 
            and supported the Government’s target of launching the first crewed <i>Gaganyaan mission by the first quarter of 2027</i>.

      <p>Speaking in the Parliament, the minister also addressed questions related to transparency and crew preparedness. 
        He Dr. Singh stated that ISRO regularly subjected the Crew Module parachute system and all associated test results 
        to independent and rigorous review mechanisms. These included the <strong>Design Review Team</strong>  (DRT), the <strong>Independent Assessment Committee</strong>, 
        and the <strong>National Advisory Panel</strong> (NAP) for Human Rating & Certification, 
        comprising eminent experts from across the country. On crew preparedness, 
        Dr. Singh reaffirmed that all systems undergo intensive testing and expert review, 
        and lessons from every qualification test are carefully analyzed, incorporated into system improvements, 
        and subsequently revalidated. </p>
        <p>
            He further highlighted that astronaut training includes comprehensive simulations of emergency scenarios, 
            survival procedures for off-nominal landings, operation of emergency survival kits, 
            and continued psychological support to ensure holistic readiness of the <strong>Gaganyatris</strong>.
