      <h1>PARLIAMENT GIVES BAS-1 MISSION UPDATE</h1>
      <h2>Confirms ISRO has finalised configuration of all BAS modules</h2>
      
      <p class="article-meta">Published on December 13, 2025 | Category: Space</p>
      
      <p>
        A press release dated 3rd December, 2025 revealed that ISRO has finalised the configuration of all five modules of India's first space station - <strong>Bharatiya Antariksh Station.</strong> 
        This came after a National Level Review Committee approved its design earlier.
        ISRO also revealed that "overall system engineering of BAS-01 module and technology development activities of various subsystems were progressing well".</p>
        <p>Development and launch of the first module BAS-1 is still targeted for 2028, 
        with the full station configuration (five modules) slated to be completed by 2035.
        ISRO also has plans to co-operate with international space agencies in operating BAS. To this end,
        ISRO is incoporating several international standards in the design of its BAS modules and their subsystems.

        <p>ISRO also hopes that such collaborations will help it in the development of technologies for Indian Human Space programme - The GAGANYAAN Mission.
      </p>
      <p>The BAS program is envisaged as the logical successor to the Gaganyaan program, 
        whose first crewed mission in 2027 will put an Indian in space, launched from Indian soil - a first. These programms, in turn, are part of the larger <strong>'India Space Vision 2047'</strong>, with the aim of landing the first <strong>Indian on the Moon by 2040.</strong></p>
